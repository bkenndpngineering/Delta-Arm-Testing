check max_endstop config

Motor 3 --> enabled, gpio 8, min_endstop disabled
Motor 2 --> disabled, gpio 0, min_endstop disabled --> fixed
Motor 1 --> disabled, gpio 0, min_endstop disabled --> fixed 

error:

odrive0 was uncomnfigured!!!

convention:
limit axis 0 -- gpio 2
limit axis 1 -- gpio 8

Superstition:

it is recommended to wait 10 seconds before rebooting odrive after saving configuration
and waiting 5 seconds after to reconnect

gpio 13, 16, 20 on RPI for limit switches


switch to shorter cables

disable endstops on odrive, increase current limit

encoder mounting plate is extremely loose on motor 1. probably why it lost its index position.

position controll works on motor 2 and 3. need to find index before position control works


working settings: 
need to increase current to support weight of arm assembly
current_lim = 40
requested_current_range = 60
calibration_current = 25

if swingd back fast, change motor direction, possibly just reboot and try again.
