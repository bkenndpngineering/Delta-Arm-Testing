Encoder calibration never ends and the motor keeps spinning. Likely due to the ODrive not finding the index pulse.
Could also be due to the ODrive firmware.

need to calibrate encoder: AXIS_STATE_ENCODER_INDEX_SEARCH

the encoder was not giving an index pulse. Swapped it out and its working!!!

need to continue with calibration
